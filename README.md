# Graph Algorithm Visualizer

A React-based interactive graph algorithm visualizer with Python code execution using Pyodide. Visualize and animate graph algorithms on directed and weighted/unweighted graphs in real-time.

---

## Features

- **Predefined and custom graphs:** Choose from empty, root-only, tree, sample graph, or create your own custom adjacency list or weighted edge list.
- **Python code editor:** Write Python code to implement graph algorithms.
- **Live Python execution:** Runs code in-browser using [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/), with async animation control.
- **Graph visualization:** Interactive, dynamic graph display using [Cytoscape.js](https://js.cytoscape.org/).
- **Animation controls:** Step-by-step highlighting of nodes and edges, with adjustable playback speed.
- **Console output:** See logged messages and exceptions directly in the UI.
- **Support for weighted and unweighted graphs.**
